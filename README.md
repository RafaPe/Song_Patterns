## Introduction
In this work we apply different unsupervised learning techniques to find patterns and groups in our untagged data. Our work is based on a dataset of songs that we built with the Spotify API. The techniques we used are clustering and frequent patterns, additionally we used visualisation as a tool to have a better understanding of the data we have and its components. In this work we present our dataset, the methodology we used and the discussion of the results that we have obtained.
